> *This project gave you the chance to get some practice with forms and bindings, while also introducing you to `DatePicker`, `Stepper`, `Date`, `DateComponents`, and more, while also seeing how to place buttons into the navigation bar – these are things you’ll be using time and time again, so I wanted to get them in nice and early.*

## &nbsp; 🎖 Challenge
* [x] Replace each `VStack` in our form with a `Section`, where the text view is the title of the section. Do you prefer this layout or the `VStack` layout? It’s your app – you choose!

* [x] Replace the “Number of cups” `Stepper` with a `Picker` showing the same range of values.

* [x] Change the user interface so that it always shows their recommended bedtime using a nice and large font. You should be able to remove the “Calculate” button entirely.
